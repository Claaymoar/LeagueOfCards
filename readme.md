Your card will do damage based on the champion mastery level and you will fight against a computer controlled player. The computers stats are based off of a real players stats(You enter in a players username you would like to play against). You will place cards and attempt to kill the enemy and destroy their nexus.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
